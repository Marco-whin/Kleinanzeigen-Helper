How to use it
Managing Templates

    Click the extension icon in your browser toolbar.

    Click "Manage Templates" to open the settings.

    Here you can add new templates, edit existing ones, or delete them. You can also reset your hidden ads list here.

Sending Messages

    On an ad page: Open the message box. You’ll see your template buttons right below the text field. Click one to insert the text.

    In Chats: The buttons also appear automatically in your active conversations.

Hiding Ads

    Click the small ✕ in the top right corner of any ad.

    An "Undo" button will appear at the bottom right for 5 seconds.

    If you don't click undo, the ad stays hidden.

Default Templates

The extension comes with 4 basic templates to get you started:

    Availability: "Hi, is this still available?"

    Price: "Hi, I'm interested. Is the price negotiable?"

    Pickup: "Hi, I'd like to pick this up. When would be a good time?"

    Shipping: "Hi, would you be willing to ship this? I'll cover the costs."

You can change or delete these at any time in the settings.

Troubleshooting

If it stops working:

    Make sure you are actually on kleinanzeigen.de.

    Refresh the page (F5).

    Go to about:debugging and reload the extension.

    Check the browser console (F12) for errors.
